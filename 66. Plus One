class Solution:
    # @param digits, a list of integer digits
    # @return a list of integer digits
    def plusOne(self, digits):
        i = len(digits) - 1
        flag = 1
        while i >= 0 and flag == 1:
            digits[i] = (digits[i] + 1) % 10
            
            if digits[i] == 0:
                i = i - 1
                if i == -1:
                    digits.insert(0,1)
            else:
                flag = 0
        return digits


Discuss:

I mistakenly use digits = digits.insert(0,1) in line 15. In this case, digits will be None, rather than what I expected that the former
digits list that has been added 1 in the front.
